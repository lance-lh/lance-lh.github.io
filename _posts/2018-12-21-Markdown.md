> * upper case will be converted to lower
> * spaces between letters will be converted to `-`

Also, from my standpoint, anchor is really helpful when you want to create an index of one long  long article. All you need to do is to normally use `h` tag to arrange your header, and then follow the format `[name](#header-name)` mentioned above.  
â€‹        With *Typora*, you can use `[TOC]` or side bar to preview your document structure since Github does not support this feature.  

### Markdown with HTML  
When you create a Markdown document, you are willing to share with others by `git push` it to Github pages. In this case, it is a browser environment for readers. Some `html` tag may help you manage your structure as follows:  
* `<p>paragraph</p>`
* `html details tag`
```
<xmp>
<details>
<summary>contens</summary>
</details>
</xmp>
```
* `<font>font_setting</font>`
* `<a id="create_anchor"></a>`

### diff  
Triple quotes with `diff` keyword to indicate update and deleted content.  
```diff
+ new contents
- deleted contents
```
